# Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neural Networks

TODO:
1. Refresh all theory, maths and calculus for Neural Nets and Deep Neural Nets.

2. Build networks.
    * From scratch with no libraries:
        - implement perceptron class.
        - implement matrix class.
        - implement activations.
        - implement basic 3 layer neural network.
    
    * With NumPy:
        - build train neural network with public datasets.
    
    * With Keras:
        - Build most accurate model possible to predict wind/solar energy generation given weather forecasts.
    
    * With PyTorch:
        - Follow tutorials for building a CNN.
